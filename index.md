 I'm a data scientist at the Northwestern Neighbourhood and Network Initiative at Northwestern University. I study the ways in which crime spreads through spatial and social networks. I'm from Hyderabad, India and I currently live and work in Chicago.

 My academic training is in Economics and Computational Social Science. I'm interested in the application of predictive analytics to crime and public health. I love reading, cooking,  all kinds of television, Indian music and flowers! ðŸŒ¸
