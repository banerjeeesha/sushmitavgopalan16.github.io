<div style="text-align:justify" font size = '2'>I'm a data scientist at the Northwestern Neighbourhood and Network Initiative at Northwestern University. I study the ways in which crime spreads through spatial and social networks. I'm from Hyderabad, India and I currently live and work in Chicago.&nbsp;&nbsp;My academic training is in Economics and Computational Social Science. I'm interested in the application of predictive analytics to crime and public health. I love reading, cooking,  all kinds of television, Indian music and flowers!ðŸŒ¸ </div>
